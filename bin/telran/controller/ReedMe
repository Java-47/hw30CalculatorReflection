To add you own operation you need to.

1. Create new Class in telran.operation package

2. Your class must contain method named "execute"

3. Method "execute" must take 2 double parameters (double a, double b) and return double value.

example:

package telran.operations;
public class YourOperation {
	
    public double execute(double a, double b) {
        double res;
		return res;
    }
}
